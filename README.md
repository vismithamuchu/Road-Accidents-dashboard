# Road-Accidents-dashboard
The Road Accidents Dashboard project using Tableau aims to provide a comprehensive visual analysis of road accident data sourced from government databases. The dashboard integrates various interactive components, including maps, charts, and filters, allowing users to explore accident trends, severity, and contributing factors. Through geographic visualizations, users can identify accident hotspots and severity distribution across regions. Time series graphs illustrate temporal patterns, while visualizations depicting accident severity and factors offer insights for informed decision-making. This dashboard serves as a valuable tool for government agencies, law enforcement, and urban planners, enabling them to take proactive measures to enhance road safety based on data-driven insights.
